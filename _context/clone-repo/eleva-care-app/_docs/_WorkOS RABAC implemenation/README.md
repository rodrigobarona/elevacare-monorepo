## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Resource:Action Pattern

```typescript
// Good (What we use)
appointments: view_own;
appointments: create;
events: edit_own;

// Bad (What we avoid)
view_appointments;
can_create_events;
edit_own_events;
```

**Why:** Consistent, scannable, grouped by resource

### 2. Role Inheritance

```typescript
Expert Top (49) = Expert Community (42) + Exclusive (7)
Partner Admin (68) = Partner Member (46) + Management (22)
```

**Why:** Easy upgrades, no permission loss, clear tiers

### 3. Ownership Scopes

```typescript
:view_own      // Only your data
:view_incoming // Data directed at you
:view_all      // All organization data (partner)
// No suffix   // Platform-wide (admin)
```

**Why:** Clear data boundaries, RLS-friendly

### 4. Progressive Enhancement

```
Patient (15)
  → Expert Community (+27) = 42
    → Expert Top (+7) = 49
      → Partner Member (+4) = 46
        → Partner Admin (+22) = 68
          → Platform Admin (+21) = 89
```

**Why:** Clear upgrade paths, value propositions

## ✅ Validation Checklist

Before going to production, verify:

### WorkOS Dashboard

- [ ] 89 permissions created
- [ ] All permission slugs match exactly (case-sensitive)
- [ ] 6 roles created
- [ ] Roles have correct priorities (1partner_admin, 7partner_admin, 8partner_admin, 6partner_admin, 9partner_admin, 1partner_adminpartner_admin)
- [ ] Permissions correctly assigned to roles
- [ ] Default role is `patient`
- [ ] JWT includes `role` and `permissions` claims

### Application Code

- [ ] Permission constants match WorkOS slugs
- [ ] Middleware uses JWT for role checks
- [ ] API endpoints validate permissions
- [ ] RLS policies check permissions (optional)
- [ ] UI shows/hides features based on permissions
- [ ] Clear error messages when permission denied

### User Experience

- [ ] Role badges displayed correctly
- [ ] Upgrade CTAs shown to users without premium features
- [ ] Permission errors are user-friendly
- [ ] Feature discovery works (users know what they're missing)
- [ ] Role transitions work (patient → expert, community → top)

### Testing

- [ ] Test with each role type

- [ ] Test role upgrades/downgrades
- [ ] Test multi-org scenarios (partner)
- [ ] Performance test (RLS queries)

## 💡 Common Questions

### Q: Can a user have multiple roles?

**A:** Yes, in different organizations. A user can be:

- `patient` in their personal org
- `expert_top` in their expert practice org
- `partner_member` in a partner org

WorkOS handles this via organization memberships.

### Q: How do I upgrade a user from Community to Top?

**A:** Update their subscription, then update their role in WorkOS:

```typescript
await workos.userManagement.updateOrganizationMembership({
  organizationMembershipId: membership.id,
  roleSlug: 'expert_top',
});
```

Their next JWT will include the new permissions.

### Q: Do I need to create Phase 2 roles now?

**A:** No. Only create Patient, Expert Community, Expert Top, and Platform Admin for Phase 1. Create Partner roles when you're ready to launch partner features.

### Q: Can I customize permissions per organization?

**A:** Yes! WorkOS supports organization-level roles. You can create custom permissions for specific partners without affecting other organizations.

### Q: How do I test permissions locally?

**A:** Mock the JWT in your tests:

```typescript
const mockJWT = {
  role: 'expert_top',
  permissions: ['analytics:view', 'events:create', ...]
};
```

### Q: What if I need a new permission?

**A:** Add it to WorkOS Dashboard, assign it to appropriate roles, then deploy code that checks it. Existing users will get it on next JWT refresh (next sign-in).
