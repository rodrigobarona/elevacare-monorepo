# Eleva.care v3 Monorepo Structure

Status: Authoritative

## Purpose

This document defines the intended monorepo structure for Eleva.care v3.

It answers:

- which apps should exist
- which packages should exist
- which boundaries each app/package owns
- how the repo should evolve over time

## Principles

- Keep app count low until product boundaries are real.
- Keep package boundaries explicit from day one.
- Share contracts across web, API, jobs, and mobile.
- Avoid duplicating domain logic inside apps.
- Make future app splitting possible without forcing it now.

## Package Manager And Tooling

- **pnpm + Turborepo** is the single installer and lockfile source of truth.
- Pin `"packageManager": "pnpm@<version>"` in root `package.json`.
- Bun is allowed as a task/script runner (`bun run`, `bun test`) but **`bun install` is banned** to prevent lockfile drift between local dev and Vercel CI.
- CI asserts no `bun.lock` exists at repo root.
- Turborepo remote cache enabled via Vercel.

## Migration From Current Scaffold (Phase 1 first task)

The repo currently ships a shadcn monorepo template on Bun:

- [apps/web](../../apps/web)
- [packages/ui](../../packages/ui)
- [packages/eslint-config](../../packages/eslint-config)
- [packages/typescript-config](../../packages/typescript-config)
- `bun.lock` + `"packageManager": "bun@1.3.5"`

Phase 1 first milestone:

1. Replace `bun.lock` with `pnpm-lock.yaml`; pin `"packageManager": "pnpm@<version>"`.
2. Keep the shadcn `components.json` configuration intact.
3. Rename workspace packages from `@workspace/*` → `@eleva/*`.
4. Keep `apps/web` as the public marketing + marketplace app; scaffold `apps/app` + `apps/api` + `apps/docs` + `apps/email` alongside it.
5. Enable Turborepo remote cache.
6. Add `eslint-plugin-import` boundary rules (see "Ownership Rules" below).

Expected route groups:

- `(expert)`
- `(patient)`
- `(org)`
- `(admin)`
- `(settings)`
- future `(academy)`

Owns:

- authenticated UX
- role-based navigation
- workspace layouts

Does not own:

- raw payment logic
- raw scheduling engine logic
- raw auth implementation details
- duplicated API/domain models

### `apps/api`

Purpose:

- webhook endpoints
- backend integration endpoints
- future stable contract for mobile and partners
- workflow triggers and backend-only orchestration

Owns:

- backend entry points
- webhook validation
- service-level API boundaries

Does not own:

- direct UI
- duplicated business rules that should live in packages

### `apps/docs`

Purpose:

### `apps/jobs` later

Purpose:

- durable workflows

This should only be introduced when `apps/api` becomes too coupled to long-running or operationally heavy jobs.

### `apps/diary-mobile` later

Purpose:

- Expo / React Native patient companion app
- symptom and health-tracking data capture
- reminders and engagement
- consented sharing to Eleva dashboard/expert flows

It should join the monorepo after the shared contract layer is stable.

│   ├── eleva-platform/       # Tier 1 — TOConline-only
│   └── expert-apps/
│       └── adapters/
│           ├── toconline/

- instrumentation helpers

### `packages/content` later

Owns:

- typed content loading
- markdown/docs helpers
- LLMs.txt and metadata helpers

## Ownership Rules

### Apps should orchestrate, packages should define

Apps should compose UI and flows.
Packages should hold the reusable domain and system logic.

### Shared logic belongs in packages

If two apps need the same:

- domain model
- validation
- service logic
- API client logic
- policy logic

it should move into a package.

### Do not let packages become random utility buckets

Each package must have:

- a clear purpose
- a stable boundary
- a small number of public entry points

## Evolution Path

### Initial state (after Phase 1 migration)

Apps:

- `apps/web` (migrated from existing scaffold)
- `apps/app`
- `apps/api`
- `apps/docs`
- `apps/email`

Packages:

- `packages/config`
- `packages/auth`
- `packages/db`
- `packages/ui` (migrated + renamed)
- `packages/compliance`
- `packages/scheduling`
- `packages/calendar`
- `packages/billing`
- `packages/accounting`
- `packages/crm`
- `packages/notifications`
- `packages/workflows`
- `packages/flags`
- `packages/audit`
- `packages/encryption`
- `packages/ai`
- `packages/eslint-config` (migrated + renamed)
- `packages/typescript-config` (migrated + renamed)

### Near-term expansion

- `packages/mobile`
- `apps/diary-mobile` (once `packages/auth`, `packages/db`, `apps/api`, `packages/notifications` have shipped v1 contracts)
- `packages/analytics`
- `packages/observability`

### Later expansion only if justified

- `apps/jobs`
- `apps/storybook`
- app split into `expert`, `patient`, or `admin`
- dedicated `academy` app

## When To Split The Product App Later

The team should consider splitting `apps/app` only if one or more become true:

- expert and patient products have materially different release cadence
- product teams become independent
- runtime or security isolation needs become distinct
- bundle and performance concerns become significant
- academy becomes a genuinely separate product surface

Until then, keep one authenticated product app.

## Dependencies And Direction

Use a dependency direction like:

```text
apps/* -> packages/*
packages/feature -> packages/foundation
packages/foundation -> no app dependency
```

Never let a package depend on an app.
